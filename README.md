# 🖐️ HAND REU: Inflatable Electroadhesive Clutches

Welcome to the repository for the **Inflatable Electroadhesive (EA) Clutches** project, part of the [NSF HAND REU](https://hand-erc.org/) program at Northwestern University.

This project focuses on the **design, fabrication, and experimental modeling** of soft inflatable electroadhesive clutches for robotic hand applications. The research aims to optimize **engagement time**, **contact area**, and **force transmission** under varying pressure and preload conditions.
